location: Paris, APC

summary: LSST impact on dark matter analysis with stellar stream
abstract: 'Dark matter subhalos with masses from 10⁶ to 10⁹ solar masses are mostly invisible, but could impact the structure of stellar streams observed by LSST. Presentation on how LSST systematics could impact establishing constraints on alternative dark matter models thanks to stellar streams analysis.'
