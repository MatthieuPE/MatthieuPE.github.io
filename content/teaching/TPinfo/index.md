## Overview  

**Course Title:** Python for 3rd-Year Physics Students  
**Duration:** 36 hours  

**Topics Covered:**  
- Core programming concepts: lists, strings, loops, functions, classes.  
- Modules and library examples: NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy.  
- Collaborative project work in the second half of the semester.  

**Teaching Methodology:**  
The course combines guided lectures, notebook-based exercises, and interactive discussions. Students progressively work on group projects, fostering problem-solving and teamwork skills.  


## Evaluation Criteria  

Grades are based on:  
1. Performance in exercises.  
2. Group project (code quality, report, and oral presentation).  

## Pedagogical Challenges  

- Introducing programming concepts to beginners.  
- Guiding group organization and dynamics.  
- Emphasizing scientific rigor in project development.  
- Illustrating the utility of simulations, and their exploitation.  
- Addressing the integration of coding with/without LLM tools.  

## Personal Contributions  

Beyond classroom instruction, my contributions include:  
1. **Enhancing Course Content:**  
   - Added corrections to notebook exercises.  
   - Introduced a section on efficient computation using NumPy (loop avoidance).  
   - Designed a new notebook on the Pandas library for optional data analysis applications.  

2. **Support for Scientific Writing:**  
   - Developed a comprehensive introduction to LaTeX, enabling students to draft professional-quality reports despite prior unfamiliarity.
