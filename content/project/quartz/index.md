A quartz tuning fork is a device commonly used in oscillators for electronic systems. 
When used in conjunction with capacitors, a resonating state can be achieved, with a high 
stability factor suited to build stable and precise clocks. 
In this study we have assumed the quartz can be modelized by the Van Dyke model. We have 
measured the impedance of a quartz crystal to ensure the model is close to the reality and
determined if it can be realized with conventional components such as capacitors, coils 
and resistors. We have then built a 1Hz clock using a quartz oscillator and characterized its 
precision.
