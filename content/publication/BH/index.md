abstract:  We study the distortions of the gas image by the analytical ray-tracing technique for polarized light artpol, that is adapted for the case of synchrotron emission. We derive analytical expressions for fast conversion of intensity/flux, polarization degree and polarization angle from the local to observer's coordinates. We put emphasis on the non-zero matter elevation above the equatorial plane and non-circular matter motions. Applications of the developed formalism include static polarimetric imaging of the black hole vicinity and dynamic polarimetric signatures of matter close to the compact object.
